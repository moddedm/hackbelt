# HackBelt üõ†Ô∏è
A command-line toolbelt for pentesters, CTF players and even normal users that organizes hacking tools, commands, and notes.
## why ?
Have you ever been in a position where you forgot the syntax of a tool so you need to go through man pages
and help commands but they make you more confused or they waste a lot of time and then you proceed to try
countless of times untill you finally find the right command even if you may have used it many times before ?

Well, With hackbelt you can just note everything you need and access them in seconds

## Features ‚ú®
- Instant command reference with `hackbelt <tool>`
- Access CTF-specific tips with `--ctf` flag
- Interactive execution of customizable snippets with `--exec`
- Tag Organization (`#web #crypto #bruteforce`)
- Full search across tools (`--search`)
- Clipboard integration (`--copy`)
- Easy syntax with multiple modes (ex: --list = -l = list) (see Usage for more)
- And many more to come soon

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moddedm/hackbelt.git
